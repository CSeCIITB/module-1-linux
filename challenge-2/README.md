# Challenge 2 (Web Mania) Linux

Proceed [here](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~akshatka/) to get started with the challenge.</br>
Each webpage links you to other and so on. You need to write a script to automate this.</br>
At the end you get a [tar](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tar-command-linux-examples/) ball. It contains the further instruction.</br>
Some commands that you might need are `wget` `grep` `find` `tar` 


## Submission instruction
In this repo inside the `challenge-2` directory we have already created `script.sh` file.</br>
Modify `script.sh` and write the script you have used for the above task.</br>
Also the first line of your `scipt.sh` should be a comment with the flag you obtained.
