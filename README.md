# Module-1 Week-1 (Linux & Bash) üêß

Welcome to the first week of the first module of Year of Security (YoS)!</br>
The topics we will study this week are <b>Linux</b> and <b>Shell Scripting</b>. <br>
<br>
Linux is an operating system just like Windows and MacOS. An operating system is a piece of code that enables the computer software to communicate and operate with the computer hardware easily. Unlike Windows and MacOS though, Linux is free and open-source. What this means is that you don't need to pay to use Linux and can even look at the [source code](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) yourself (unlike other operating systems where the source code is a trade secret).<br>
The freedom and simplicity Linux offers make it a popular choice among developers and hackers. Hence, many applications that we will use throughout this course are exclusively available on Linux systems. Apart from all this, Linux is much more reliable, performant and customizable than other operating systems.

There are a lot of ways to get a Linux system running on your computer : you may choose to dual boot Linux with Windows, install WSL2 on windows (Window's Subsystem for Linux) or use Linux in a Virtual Machine. <br>
For the sake of this course, you can use the CSec Club's very own [Virtual Machine](https://iitbacin-my.sharepoint.com/personal/180050089_iitb_ac_in/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2F180050089%5Fiitb%5Fac%5Fin%2FDocuments%2FCsec%202021%2D22%2FTools), which comes preinstalled with most of the cybersecurity tools you will ever need. If you choose to dual boot or use WSL, you will need to select a "distribution" of Linux to install. [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) is a popular choice for beginners, but you may search for and use alternatives.<br>

This week's content also includes an introduction to shell scripting. Shell scripting enables one to automate tasks that otherwise require 100s of mouse clicks and other interesting stuff. The resources below will be help you to gain familiarity with both linux and shell scripting. If you are wondering how all this is relevant to hacking or solving CTF (capture the flag) challenges, we have several video walkthroughs linked below.
