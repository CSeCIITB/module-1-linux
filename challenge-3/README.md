# Challenge 3 (env Pollution) Linux
We have provided you 3 [ELF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format) files(compiled C codes)

In each level you need to perform some tasks to get the flag
- level1: get the [environment variables](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/environment-variables-in-linux-unix/) in the spawned shell
- level2: launch the program with no environment variables
- level3: launch the program with an environment variable `CSeC=Awesome`; ensure that the [`argv[0]`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3024202) is equal to `YoS`

PS: You may skip level3. Since you will get to know more about it in the upcoming weeks

## Submission instruction
In this repo inside the `challenge-3` directory we have already created `level1.txt level2.txt level3.txt` files.</br> 
Write all the `commands` that you have used to solve for each challenge (one on each line)</br>
Also while submission the first line of each text file should be the flag you obtained
